# Test 1.
# We want to add 3 values to the array: 'arr'.
# These values can be anything, as long as there are 3 of them.
# Write your code below this line.

arr.append(6)

# Write your code above this line.

# Test 2.
# Create a variable with floating point numbers (decimal/fraction).
# Name this correctly (relating to its use, and use camel-case).
# Write your code below this line.

floatArray = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5]

# Write your code above this line.

# Test 3.
# Using the variable you just created, add 2 (or more) floating point numbers.
# Write your code below this line.

floatArray.append(6.6)

# Write your code above this line.
