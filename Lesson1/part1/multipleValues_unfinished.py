x = 100

print(x)

# If we run this code, and look in the console, it will print 100 out 3 times.
# Instead of that, we want it to print out 100, 200, and 300.
# Do not modify any of the 'print' statements, instead, change x's value.

# Test 1.
# Change x's value to '200'
# Write your code below this line.



# Write your code above this line.

print(x)

# Test 2.
# Change x's value to '300'
# Write your code below this line.



# Write your code above this line.
