# This lesson is to check if python is installed properly.
# If your code does not run, look back to the README and follow
# the instructions for installing python.

# Test 1.
# We will be printing "Hello World" to the console.
# To do that we will call 'print'
# hint: type "print()".
# Inside the parenthesis, put a pair of quotation marks, and write "Hello World", inside of them.

# Write your code below this line

print("Hello World")

# Write your code above this line
