# Test 1.
# Let's print out your name, then your age, and where you're from.
# EX: Conquavious, 93, Ohio.
# Write your code below this line.

print("Jaquavious, 17.9, Utah")

# Write your code above this line.

# Test 2.
# We're going to print out the current date.
# Instead of it all being in one string, they should be seperated.
# EX: 25 + "/" + 10 + "/" + 22
# Write your code below this line.

print(25 + "/" + 12 + "/" + 2022)

# Write your code above this line.
